\chapter{Data}

Because there is intrinsic variability in the number of near-Earth objects colliding with Earth's atmosphere from night to night, a sufficiently large data sample plays a vital role in estimating an average flux.
This chapter details our data sample, specifically with respect to the time, observable area, and fireball distributions\comment{What is this referring to?}.  
To assess the overall capabilities of our system, we also delve into the data behind our star catalog, previously used for total observable area calculations.  
This chapter provides the raw data and overall distribution and shape of the data. Further analysis and interpretation of the data can be found in Chapter 5.

\section{Time Distributions}

While the D6 AllSky Camera has a protective watertight shell, it is currently not always placed outside for nightly observations due to precaution and convenience.
Due to Oregon's climate, we often leave our observation system inside.
There have been a total of $221$ days between August 27, 2018, the beginning of Willamette's academic year, and May 6, 2019.
Out of those $221$ days, we have observed during \hl{$34$} nights, for a total of \hl{$291.87$} hours.

When outside, the D6 AllSky Camera automatically begins observation runs when the sky is dark enough to take videos of without fear of over-saturation.
As the sky gets brighter when sunrise approaches, the camera automatically shuts off, ending the observation session.
This brightness constraint means that the total observation time changes from night to night.
During observation nights, we observed for an average of \hl{$8.584$} hours per night.
The shortest observation session lasted \hl{$7$} hours while the longest lasted \hl{$11$}\comment{Interesting. That is surprisingly long and a little suspicious to me.} hours.

Figure~\ref{dateplot} displays the individual nights that we observed throughout the academic calendar. 
In addition to plotting our observation dates and each session's total observing time, we have indicated dates of meteor showers visible in Salem, Oregon.  
During the months of October and November, we observed on nights of the Orionid and Leonid showers respectively.

\section{Coverage Distributions}

As described in the methodology section, to calculate the angular distance per pixel for a given location, we needed two different celestial object measurements.\comment{Did you need two objects or did you need two measurements? This sounds like measurements which then conflicts with the next sentence.}
By taking the angular separation between the two, we designated the ratio to be at the midpoint between both locations.  
In total, we used \hl{$2638$} different comparisons to compile our angular distance per pixel dataset.  
Figure~\ref{angperpix1} shows all of these points, each colored with their respective angular separation per pixel ratio.  

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/angular_distance_at_various_locations.png}
  \caption{A plot of angular distance per pixel measurements from celestial comparisons. \inlinecomment{Why are they grouped the way they are? How do you feel about the coverage? Comment more about the plot itself! Also, this plot badly needs axes and label sizes that match the plot below, especially when they are on the same page like this!}}
  \label{angperpix1}
\end{figure}

One may note that Figure~\ref{angperpix1} shows many data points, but they do not span the entirety of the camera field. 
There are many regions with no data points.
Because\comment{missing word?} has a view that is symmetric about the azimuth, we rotated all of our data points by a fixed quantity and appended them to the current data set.  
This assumption of azimuthal symmetry allowed us to attain more complete data coverage without sacrificing data quality.
By rotating and appending in sequences of $5\degree$ in a full unit circle, we were able to increase the number of data points by a magnitude of \hl{$71.53$}.
From this point we were able to then bin\comment{Why bin the data?} the data and create Fig~\ref{colorful}.\comment{You need another sentence say commenting on what is shown in that figure.}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/boxes_colored.png}
  \caption{Average angular separation per pixel for different camera pixel regions.}
  \label{colorful}
\end{figure}

As described in the Background chapter, we used our measured solid angles for each region to calculate individual rectangular pyramid-created sky areas\comment{Got to come up with a better name or description than that} at a fixed radius of \SI{11.4}{\kilo\meter}
Our measured total areal coverage was \hl{$->$} \SI{58974.88}{\square\kilo\meter} \hl{$<-$}.

As some nights were cloudy and others clear, the observable area fluctuated from night to night. 
Figure~\ref{time_area} summarizes the total observation time and the average observable area for each of our observation months. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/time_vs_areaobs_plot.png}
  \caption{A plot of total observation time and average observable area for each month. \inlinecomment{Say more! Why include this plot!? Any interesting features?}}
  \label{time_area}
\end{figure}

Our average observable area across all observations was \hl{$->$} \SI{56012.03}{\square\kilo\meter}\hl{$<-$}.
This value, along with our total observation time and number of events was used to determine the overall average flux.

\section{Detected Fireballs}

In total, the D6 AllSky Camera captured a total of \hl{$1095$} videos.  
Of those \hl{$1095$}, only \hl{$6$} were identified as real fireballs.\comment{Lordy this sounds terrible. Probably need to comment on why the trend was like this.}
A depiction of the locations of these fireballs is shown in Figure~\ref{fireball_locs}.\comment{Need a sentence commenting on what this image shows.} 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/fireball_initlocs.png}
  \caption{The initial pixel locations of all detected fireballs.\inlinecomment{So what? Why should I care or what is interesting about this?}}
  \label{fireball_locs}
\end{figure}

Of the \hl{$6$} fireballs, $3$ were found within $24$ hours of the Leonid meteor shower while $1$ more was found during the Orionid meteor shower.  

Unfortunately, the photometry program used to analyze fireball light-curves had issues processing each of these cases, and there was not enough time to troubleshoot and fix that program.  
Therefore, we do not have calibrated luminosities for our observed fireballs and can not make a prediction of their energy or mass at the moment. 


\section{Camera Capabilities}

As described in Chapter 3, the star catalog consists of recognized stars from the D6 AllSky Camera's snapshots.
In a catalog containing a total of \hl{$317$} rows\comment{stars?} we observed an average of \hl{$1.396$} stars per snapshot containing at least one star.
In total, the system took \hl{$1642$} snapshots, and \hl{$279$} of them contained identifiable celestial objects (stars or the moon).  
Within those \hl{$227$} videos, we captured information on \hl{$13$} unique objects.
Of these objects, the brightest had a visible apparent magnitude of $2$.  
This star is Alpheratz.\comment{What about the dimmest? That is far more interesting to us as it sets a sort of lower scale on the dimmest objects that we could expect to see and detect.}
